h1. Introduction

Miso is a [Python for S60 http://www.forum.nokia.com/python] utility
library, which was developed in the [PDIS http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/]
project at [HIIT http://www.hiit.fi/]. The idea of the library is to
provide simple utility functions and classes that are easy to
implement using native Symbian OS resources, but which would be
difficult or impossible to implement in pure Python.

The library consists of a single Symbian OS native dynamic link
library that has a Python interface. We have tested it on S60 v2 and
v3 phones only, but don't know of any reason why it would fail to run
on S60 v1 phones. We have found the library to build with a number of
different Nokia S60 SDKs, using GCC, GCCE and MSVC 6.0 compilers. We
have done both Windows and Linux hosted builds, with Nokia (on
Windows), [GnuPoc http://www.hiit.fi/files/fi/da/gnupoc/] (on Linux),
and [sdk2unix http://www.hiit.fi/files/fi/da/sdk2unix/] (on Linux)
style SDK installations, respectively.

h1. Status

Most of the Miso functionality has been around for a long time, and is
thus reasonably well tested. We are not, however, too worried about
adding (or removing) features of a more experimental nature.

h1. Examples

The [programs used to test Miso features ../test-programs] also serve as example programs.

h1. License

: [license COPYING]
The license covering the software. (This file is also included in the source tree, and archived copies thereof.)


h1. Documentation

API documentation for the current (possibly unstable) version of Miso is available in both [HTML ../python-api/html/index.html] and [Python ../src/miso.py] formats.

Each (versioned) release of Miso also comes with API documentation. See the [downloads directory ../download] and the [older releases page older-releases.html].

h1. Releases

: Version
1.98
: Release Date
2.10.2009
: Changes
Due to reported problems with ``imp.load_dynamic``, now building
without a ``.py`` wrapper---were not using it for pure Python
additions anyway. S60 v3.1 and v3.2 ``py2`` variants now built for
PyS60 1.9.7.


: Version
1.97
: Release Date
13.5.2009
: Changes
Now built with S60 v3.2 SDK also. (v3.2 build signed with Location capability.)
All S60 v3.x builds now have both PyS60 1.4.5 and 1.9.4 variants.


: Version
1.96
: Release Date
26.2.2009
: Changes
Added ``have_process`` (cf. ``kill_process``) and ``miso_version`` functions.


: Version
1.95
: Release Date
3.1.2009
: Changes
``stack_info`` actually built in.


: Version
1.94
: Release Date
18.12.2008
: Changes
UID now of the test range, to allow for Open Signed Online use. (This probably means that v1.94 cannot be installed before uninstalling any earlier version.)
Added ``stack_info`` function, inspired by [LogMan http://code.google.com/p/logman-for-symbian/] and its ``RLogMan::StackInfo`` function for logging stack usage. ``stack_info`` may be useful when getting KERN-EXEC 3 panics, and wondering whether there is enough stack space.


: Version
1.93
: Release Date
17.2.2008
: Changes
Using the ``CHWRMVibra`` API for vibra functionality in 3rd edition builds.
Added ``kill_process`` function.
Made ``initmiso`` the only C++ export, also for GCCE builds.



h2. Older Releases

For binaries, source, and documentation of older releases of Miso, see the [older releases page older-releases.html].

h1. Software Download

A [collection of release builds ../download] is available. The ``sisx`` installation packages are signed, while the ``sis`` ones are not. ``s60_3x`` variants require signing, whereas ``s60_1x`` and ``s60_2x`` variants do not. The ``self`` variants have maximum self-signed capabilities, while the ``dev`` variants have maximum Symbian Open Signed capabilities. The ``py1`` variants are for Python for S60 v1.3/v1.4, while the ``py2`` variants are for Python for S60 v1.9.

Note that we are supplying binaries built for a number
of different S60 platform versions, despite all S60 releases except for 3rd Edition having so far retained---to an extent---binary compatibility. While most of the utilities in the library only make use of well-established APIs, and are thus likely to run on any somewhat binary compatible S60 device regardless of which build is being used, the library does have some platform specificity, to the extent that some functionality hasn't even been implemented for all versions of the S60 platform. To reduce the likelihood of incompatibilities, you're best off installing whichever SIS file is the closest match for your phone.

h1. Source Code

A [darcs http://darcs.net/] repository of the [source code ..] (with
change history) is also available, and can be retrieved with the
``get`` command of ``darcs``.

h1. Dependencies

Depends on the [Python for S60 http://www.forum.nokia.com/python/] runtime. Does not depend on non-public APIs or anything exotic. Python must be installed on the target device to run this software. The appropriate Python SDK plugin(s) must be installed on the development host to build this software.

h1. Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Send patches to the below email address.
The ``send`` command of ``darcs`` may be used.

h2. SourceForge Hosting

The Miso source code repository is also hosted at [SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/], and while that repository presently does not contain the most recent code, this situation could be rectified if it should be helpful for contributors to have direct access to the source repository.
